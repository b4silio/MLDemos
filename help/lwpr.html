<h2>Locally Weighed Projection Regression</h2>
<br>
Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) is a recent algorithm
that achieves nonlinear function approximation in high dimensional
spaces with redundant and irrelevant input dimensions. At its core, it
uses locally linear models, spanned by a small number of univariate
regressions in selected directions in input space. A locally weighted
variant of Partial Least Squares (PLS) is employed for doing the
dimensionality reduction.<br>
