    <h2>Optimization</h2>
    The Optimization panel allows to test, tweak and observe how
    different algorithms perform a function optimization in a
    2-dimensional parameter space: "the canvas". The value (or reward)
    of the function at a specific position in parameter space is
    displayed by the amount of red, which can be painted on using the
    Paint Reward tool in the drawing options.<br>
    <br>
    The canvas will display the process of optimization from a given
    starting position (provided by the "Drag me" drag-and-drop button.
    If no starting position is provided, a random position in parameter
    space will be selected. <br>
    <br>
    The canvas displays different information in multiple layers, which
    can be toggled using the display options. These are:
    <ul>
      <li>Samples: the original function value (reward), high colors
        correspond to high reward value</li>
      <li>Learned Model: the optimization history (lined path), current
        best parameters (green circles), visited parameter instances
        (black circles), and (optionally) additional model information
        (e.g. set of active particles)</li>
      <li>Model Info: representation of the reward function as elevation
        contour lines</li>
      <li>Legend: the current maximum value found (the maximum is always
        normalized to 1) </li>
    </ul>
    A yellow zone indicates the region of parameter space in which the
    function value is maximum or higher than a given Stop Criterion. The
    optimization process will stop after a set number of iterations has
    been performed, or when a sufficient function value is reached.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">In Practice</span><br>
    The easiest way to test optimization is to:
    <ol>
      <li>Paint some reward (left-click) in the canvas </li>
      <li>Click on "Optimize"</li>
    </ol>
    This should initialize the algorithm and start animating the
    exploration of the parameter space.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Options and Commands</span><br>
    The interface for optimization (the right-hand side of the Algorithm
    Options dialog) provides the following commands:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimize: Initialize and start the optimization using the
        currently selected algorithm and options</li>
      <li>Stop/Start: pause or restart the optimization process (will
        not reset the iteration count)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Clear: clear the current regression model (does NOT clear the
        data)</li>
    </ul>
    and the following options:
    <ul>
      <li>Starting Position: (draggable) defines the starting position
        for the optimization process. Re-drag to remove</li>
      <li>Max Iterations: Maximum number of iterations to compute </li>
      <li>Stop Criterion: Target minimal value to be attained before
        stopping (range: [0, 1]). </li>
    </ul>
    All other options are algorithm-dependent and should be described in
    the help menu of the algorithm itself.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate Rewards</span><br
      style="font-weight: bold;">
    It is possible to generate a set of pre-constructed rewards by
    dragging and dropping a gaussian of fixed size (Var option) or a
    gradient from the center of the canvas to the dropped position.
    Alternatively a number of standard benchmark functions is proposed.
    Use the Set button to draw the benchmark function onto the canvas.<br>
